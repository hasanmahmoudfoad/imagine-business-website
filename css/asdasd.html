<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last update : 2nd August 2019</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are delighted to welcome you to our website </span><a href="http://www.xxxx.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.majouri.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We endeavour to ensure, to the best of our abilities, the accuracy and the updates of the information that appears on this site, the content of which we reserve the right to correct, at any time and without notice. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, the precision or the comprehensiveness of the information available on this site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, we do not accept any responsibility:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for any imprecision, inaccuracy or omission about the information available on the site;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for any damage resulting from a fraudulent intrusion of a third-party having led to a modification of the information available on the site;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">and more generally for any direct or indirect damage, whatever the cause, origin, nature or consequence may be, provoked by anybody accessing the site, or the impossibility of accessing it, use of the site and / or credit given to any information coming directly or indirectly from the site.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present terms and conditions are systematically brought to the knowledge of each purchaser to enable him or her to place an order on the present website, superseding any other conditions, particularly those applicable in stores.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, the act of placing an order implies the purchaserâ€™s complete adherence, without reservation, to these terms and conditions that supersede any other documents, such as prospectuses or catalogues issued by the vendor, which only have an indicative value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any conflicting conditions set down by the purchaser will therefore, except for express acceptance, be non-invocable to the vendor, whatever the moment when it could have been brought to his or her knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the vendor does not invoke at a given moment any of the present terms and conditions cannot be interpreted as worthy of renunciation to later invoke any of the aforementioned conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We invite you to consult the description of each product to find out more about its characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sale of our products on the present site is reserved exclusively for the end customer, that is to say, any physical person not functioning as a trader and having the legal capacity to contract. Consequently, orders originating from professionals will not be honoured by MAISON DE MAA. In this respect, MAISON DE MAA reserves the right to cancel any order of an abnormal nature such as an order with quantities of products exceeding the normal needs of one customer or abnormal numbers of orders to the same invoicing and/or delivery address.</span></p>
